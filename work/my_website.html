    <h1>the title</h1>
    <p>I write music reviews on a website called <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/">
        Album of the Year</a>
        , on my profile, <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/pixelcouch/">
        pixelcouch</a>
        . I have more recently tended towards soundtrack reviews because that's what I listen to,
        being someone who doesn't really sit down and listen to new music often, but I do have a decent,
        if small, collection of actual album reviews - the best ones being my CLariS reviews,
        as they're my favourite artists, but really I think any review I have written since Soen's 'Tellurian' is worth reading.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        My favourite reviews I have written do not necessarily correspond to my favourite albums, as you can see.
        The list is in no particular order since I have no clue which is my actual top favourite.

        <dt>Weezer - SZNZ: Winter</dt>
            <dd><img src="img/Weezer - SZNZ Winter.jpg" alt="The Weezer SZNZ Winter album cover, depicting an aged stone head in a snowy forest"/>
                <br>
                This one is a fairly early review, from back in the good old days when I actually wrote them within a reasonable timeframe.
                Still, I think it reflects my current style nicely, going song-by-song and then ending with overall thoughts, analysis and closing remarks.
                This was mostly chosen due to my analysis of the SZNZ project as a whole, something I'm quite proud of,
                as it justified my love for a set of albums which most people agree are pretty bad.

        <dt>Shinkichi Mitsumune - Rozen Maiden Original Soundtrack</dt>
            <dd><img src="img/Rozen Maiden.jpg" alt="The Rozen Maiden Soundtrack cover, depicting three of the main characters in a field of flowers"/>
                <br>
                This one, on the other hand, is much more recent - one of the newest reviews I've written, and for one of my favurite soundtracks
                to one of my favourite shows of all time. I believe this is the longest review on my page currently
                (though an even longer one is in the works and nearing completion), despite me intentionally skipping sixteen songs, which says a lot about
                how much I love this soundtrack.
            </dd>
        <dt>CLariS - Fairy Party</dt>
            <dd><img src="img/Claris - Fairy Party.jpg" alt="The Rozen Maiden Soundtrack cover, depicting three of the main characters in a field of flowers"/>
                <br>
                And the third and final notable review is actually one I gave a mixed rating - however, I think this is my best and most comprehensive
                CLariS review to date; even the uninteresting 'J-Pop slop' as I referred to it got fairly lengthy commentary and description,
                with compliments given to good bits and explanations given for why I didn't like them overall. Then there's the much more
                involved commentary on the songs I did like, which again is the most comprehensive of maybe any review to date, with
                'Parallel Warp', 'Last Squall', 'TRAVEL', and 'Cynical Suspense' all getting lengthy paragraphs with a lot of detail.
